## Example1: run hello_from_module.py from the command line. 

In this example you will run the hello_from_module.py program which imports the
test_module.py python module and calls the functions "say_hello" and "count" which
are defined in that module. 

1. Copy the hello_from_module.py and test_module.py files to a directory on
   your computer. In the example below we put them into the a directory called
   "example2" in Documents.  

2. Open the windows command prompt and change directory using the "cd" command
   to the directory containing the files. 

3. Check that both files are in the current directory using the "dir" command.  

4. Run the "hello_from_module.py" program by entering "python hello_world.py"
   on the command line from the example2 directory. The output should look like
   that shown below.
